    // An Array is an object type designed for storing data collections.
// Elements: An array is a list of values, known as elements.
// Ordered: Array elements are ordered based on their index.
// Zero indexed: The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
// Dynamic size: Arrays can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.
// Heterogeneous: Arrays can store elements of different data types (numbers, strings, objects and other arrays).
